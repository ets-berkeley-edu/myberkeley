This module handles storage and retrieval of CalCentral Tasks and Events.

Currently, delivered Tasks and Events are stored in the recipient's home folder,
but with significant restrictions on write access. (For example, the recipient
cannot modify the is-required status or description of the Task or Event.)

Much of the code here reflects an earlier implementation which relied on storage
in an external Bedework server. It still runs and is still testable, and we'll
keep it in place at least until all servers have migrated to the new storage
approach.
